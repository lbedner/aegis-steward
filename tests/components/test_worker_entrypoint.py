"""The worker runs inside a loop it started itself.

``python -m arq <settings>`` calls ``asyncio.get_event_loop()`` with no
running loop, which is a RuntimeError on Python 3.14. arq's own watch
flag hid it by running the worker inside ``asyncio.run`` - so the dev
branch worked, the non-dev branch had been dead for as long as the
project has been on 3.14, and moving dev onto the same command as
production is what surfaced it (2026-09-22).

One entrypoint for both branches, and it owns the loop.
