"""A dialog's own buttons can close it without pretending it might not exist.

A dialog's actions are constructed before the dialog is, so seventeen
call sites across eleven files opened with ``dialog: StyledAlertDialog |
None = None`` and then re-checked inside the handler:

    if dialog is not None:
        dialog.open = False

That check can never fail - the button cannot be clicked before the
dialog it lives in has been built - so the ``| None`` is a lie told to
the type checker, and the guard is ceremony around it.

A handle is created first, handed to the dialog, and closed by name.
