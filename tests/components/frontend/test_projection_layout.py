"""The Projected tab: chart beside the ledger, not above it.

Stacked, the chart ate the height and left the ledger ~4 visible rows -
"I need to be able to see more transactions." The two halves answer one
question together (the line says WHEN the balance turns, the rows say
WHAT turns it), so they sit side by side rather than in sub-tabs, which
would hide exactly that correlation.
