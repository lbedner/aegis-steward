"""One lifecycle, owned once, for every finance panel.

Each panel used to hand-roll the same trio - fetch on mount, reload on
account-filter change, reload on tab revisit - and each copy drifted:
Budget shipped without the filter leg, Projection shipped without the
revisit leg (a confirmed payment stayed invisible on the Projected page
until the dialog reopened - confirmed live). The base owns all three;
a panel implements ``_load`` and cannot forget a leg it never writes.
