"""Control-tree walkers for the Flet component suite.

One canonical traversal. Before this file, ``_walk``/``_texts`` were
re-typed in five test files and had already drifted - one returned a
list of ``ft.Text`` values (``None`` included), one a list of non-empty
strings, one a newline-joined blob - which is the same failure mode the
finance factories module exists to prevent. Files alias these on import
(``from tests.components.frontend._tree import texts as _texts``) so
call sites stay short.
