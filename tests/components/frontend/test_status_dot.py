"""The status dot, in its two forms.

``status_dot()`` is the bare circle - a cell marker, no words. ``StatusDot``
is the labelled form: the same circle with its meaning spelled out beside
it, which is what the dashboard actually shows wherever a state needs
naming (Bills & Income's streams, the Budget tab's Fixed / Non-monthly
rows, an import's scheduled and errored counts).

The labelled form is a CONTROL rather than a helper returning a bare
Container on purpose: a caller that wants "the house dot" should be able
to reach for a name, and anything checking that a surface uses it should
be able to ask, instead of recognising a circle by its pixel size.
