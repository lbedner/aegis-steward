"""The register header's layout contract.

Its title/subtitle Column is the only flexible child of a Row otherwise
full of fixed-width controls (seven range chips, a 280px search box). Flex
gets what is LEFT, so every fixed control added to that Row comes out of
the title's width - and past the limit it collapses to a few pixels and
wraps one character per line down the page. Confirmed live once three
bulk-action chips were added to it.

So the rule this pins: selection controls belong on their own row, and
the title text can never wrap even if the rule is broken again.
