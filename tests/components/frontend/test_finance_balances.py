"""Tests for the finance modal's account balance display rule.

``current_balance`` starts at 0 for every created account, so a bare zero
is "nobody ever set a balance", not "the balance is zero" - unless a
``balance_as_of`` stamp says a real balance write happened (provider sync,
statement import, valuation). Without that distinction a freshly imported
register full of transactions renders $0.00 on every account.
