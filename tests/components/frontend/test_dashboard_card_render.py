"""Every dashboard card still renders what it used to.

Cards read ``ComponentStatus.metadata`` through ``.get(key, default)``,
so a field that stops being populated does not raise and does not fail a
test - it renders ``0``, ``-`` or blank. A backend modal read
``core_count`` while the health check published ``cpu_count``, and
advertised "0 cores" on every machine until somebody counted.

That is a refactor hazard more than a bug: moving a card between files,
or splitting one that has grown too large, can drop a metric and leave
every existing test green. So each card's rendered field COUNT is
recorded here, and the assertion is one-directional - a card may grow,
but it may not quietly shrink. Counts rather than exact copy, so
rewording a label is not a test failure; losing the label is.

The cards are discovered, not listed, so a stack tests the cards it
actually has and a new card cannot join without recording its number.
