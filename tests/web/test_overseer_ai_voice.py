"""The Overseer AI page's Voice section: what speaks and what listens (from
settings, with each provider's key state), every voice of the speaking
provider with a play button, a sentence spoken in a chosen voice, and an
audio file transcribed. Playback rides the voice API's preview route;
transcription is the speech API's own function."""
