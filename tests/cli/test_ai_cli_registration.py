"""Every ``ai`` command is registered on the group ``main.py`` mounts.

``app/cli/ai`` is a package: the Typer app lives in ``shared`` and the
commands are decorated across six sibling modules, so registration
depends on ``__init__`` importing each of them. Those imports look
unused, and an import sorter, a linter's autofix, or a well-meaning
cleanup can remove them.

Nothing else notices if they go. The package still imports, ruff and ty
stay green, and ``aegis init`` renders a project whose whole suite
passes - the only symptom is ``ai --help`` listing less than it should.
That is exactly what happened to the rag package while it was being
split: the decorators were dropped, every check stayed green, and the
CLI was silently empty.

So this asserts the names, not just that the module imports.
