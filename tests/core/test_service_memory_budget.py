"""What each service costs in memory to load, held to a budget.

A service's dependencies (a provider SDK, a PDF library, an embedding model
pulling in torch) add to every process that loads it, and a review cannot
see that. Each installed service's whole package is imported in a fresh
interpreter on top of what every process loads anyway (config, logging),
and the memory it adds is held to the budget below: over it fails, naming
the service and by how much.

The budget is a ratchet. It records what each service costs today, with
room for noise between machines; raise a service's entry in the same
change that adds the weight, on purpose, and lower it when a change makes
the service lighter.
