"""Every session the app opens for itself lands in the app-owned test database.

``_no_production_database`` redirects the module-level session factories in
``app.core.db`` so startup hooks, background tasks and service code that open
their own session never touch the database in ``DATABASE_URL``. The sync
factory must be covered as well as the async one: ``db_session()`` is what
startup hooks and the scheduler still use, and on a Postgres project nothing
else creates tables for it (startup migrations begin with ``CREATE SCHEMA``,
which SQLite rejects), so an uncovered sync path fails with "no such table"
on the first lookup a route makes after a write.
