"""Every migration must carry a stamp signature.

The startup hook re-adopts a persisted database by checking, per pending
migration, whether its signature object already exists - and stamping
instead of replaying the DDL. A migration that ships without a signature
opts out of that recovery: the day a volume outlives its version row, the
upgrade replays, and the database logs an "already exists" error on every
boot until someone stamps by hand. That is not hypothetical - 004..007
shipped unsigned and did exactly this.
