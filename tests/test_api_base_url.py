"""Every CLI that calls this app's own API needs its address.

``make serve`` shifts the published host port when 8000 is taken, while
the container keeps listening on ``PORT``. A CLI command runs on the
host, so it needs the published one. Before this, ``API_BASE_URL`` did
not exist at all and every caller fell back to a hardcoded
``localhost:8000``: the port moved and the clients did not follow.
