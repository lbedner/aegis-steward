"""Split transactions: one purchase, many categories.

The schema (``FinanceTransactionSplit`` + ``is_split``) predates this;
these tests pin the surface that makes it a feature. The contract:

- The parent row is never touched - its amount, category and history
  stay exactly as imported. Splits are separate child rows.
- Parts are given as positive magnitudes and the service fills the
  difference: split a $76 Target run knowing only "food was $25" and a
  $51 remainder line inheriting the parent's own category appears.
- Category reporting swaps a split parent for its lines - budgets and
  the categories tab count $25 of food, not $76 of Shopping - while
  payee, cashflow and account math stay on the parent (the lines sum to
  it, so nothing double-counts).
