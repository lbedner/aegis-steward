"""Pausing a bill: a stated, self-expiring silence.

"I know I need to pause some investments for a few months." A pause is
``paused_until`` on the stream - lazy by design, nothing ever un-sets
it; the day the date passes, every consumer's comparison flips on its
own. One predicate feeds every surface, because the money math
disagreeing with itself is exactly what mute taught us: a muted bill
vanished from the forecast but kept counting in the Bills total, so the
header and the Projected tab told different stories. The pause work
fixes that inconsistency for mute in the same pass.
