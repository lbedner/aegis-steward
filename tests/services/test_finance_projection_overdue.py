"""Overdue occurrences: money still in flight is not money that vanished.

The forecast fast-forwards each stream past occurrences dated before
today. Skipping ALL of them reads a one-day-late paycheck as "you are
$5,000 poorer for the next two weeks" - the walk starts from a balance
the check never reached and never charges the check anywhere. The rule:
the LATEST missed occurrence carries to today (it is in flight - a late
check, a bill due but not yet drafted); everything older is a stale
stream's echo, already in the starting balance or the insight rules'
missed-payment chase, and stays skipped.
