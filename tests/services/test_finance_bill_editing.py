"""Editing a bill's category and account.

The category shown on Bills & Income is DERIVED - ``stream_category_names``
reads the most common category across the stream's member transactions,
because ``finance_recurring_stream.category_id`` is a provider field the
local detector never fills. So storing a category is only half the job: if
the display keeps deriving, the edit silently does nothing.

Setting it must NOT touch the member transactions (chosen deliberately -
a bulk rewrite would overwrite per-transaction corrections made by hand).
