"""A currency lookup is resolved once per session, not once per row.

``get_or_create_currency`` is called on every path that writes a row
carrying a currency FK - every security, price, holding, trade, budget
line, recurring stream, and every row of a provider sync loop. Each call
issued its own SELECT for a table that holds a handful of immutable rows,
which is the single largest source of repeated statements in the suite.
