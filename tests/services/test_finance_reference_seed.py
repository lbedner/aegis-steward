"""The reference seed has to survive the session the startup hook uses.

Currencies and CSV import profiles are seeded on boot so a fresh install
can import a Chase or AMEX file immediately. The profile rows carry a
currency, and that currency is a foreign key, so the currency rows have
to be in the database before the profiles are written.

Adding both to one session and committing once is not enough. The app's
sync session factory is built with ``autoflush=False``, so nothing
reaches the database until the commit, and the insert order chosen then
does not put the currencies first: the key points at ``code``, which is
not the primary key, so the dependency is invisible to the sort. On a
fresh database the whole seed rolled back with a foreign-key error, and
the startup hook logged it as a warning and carried on - leaving an
install with no import profiles and no obvious reason why.
