"""Module boundaries inside the finance service's domain packages.

Behavioural tests cannot see this: every call reaches the same function
through the ``FinanceService`` facade whether the domain lives in one
1,000-line module or four small ones. So a later change that folds a
domain back together, or lands a new function in whichever file was open
at the time, passes the whole suite. These assertions are the only place
the split is stated, and they fail on the drift rather than on a name.
