"""Tests for a payee name that OUTLIVES the transactions it was given to.

Naming a payee used to be a one-time stamp: ``assign_merchant`` set
``merchant_id`` on the rows in front of you and nothing recorded what the
bank descriptor meant. The next import arrived payee-less and offered the
same groups for naming again - on the real ledger, ShopRite among them,
already named months earlier.

The category axis has had this since the beginning
(``FinanceCategoryAlias``: free text -> canonical category, written on
create, read at import). These cover the merchant axis catching up.

An alias keys on ``transaction_payee_key`` - the same four-token
grouping the user was shown when they named it. Keying on the whole
descriptor was tried first and measured against the real ledger, where
it is close to useless: ShopRite's 407 transactions carry 211 distinct
descriptors (the card tail and date are baked into each) and only 8
prefixes, so half of next month's rows would arrive as text nobody had
ever seen.

The prefix is a heuristic, and these pin down what that costs. 5 of the
ledger's 240 named prefixes mean more than one payee - "NON CHASE ATM
WITHDRAW" covers four - so a key taught a second payee is treated as a
conflict rather than a correction, and stops resolving unattended.
