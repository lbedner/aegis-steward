"""One-time bills: "I gotta pay someone back."

A real obligation with a date and an amount, but no cadence - paying Bob
$500 on the 15th. It belongs in Bills (it IS a bill: it must be
remembered, forecast, and chased if missed), so it rides the recurring
stream with frequency ``once`` rather than a parallel table. What makes
it different is everything cadence-shaped: it projects exactly one
occurrence, never steps, and contributes nothing to the monthly rollup.
