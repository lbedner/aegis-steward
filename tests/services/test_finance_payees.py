"""Tests for managing payees directly, rather than as a side effect.

Until now the ONLY way to set a payee's website was the No payee tab's
group dialog, which also re-filed the transactions it was opened on - so
correcting a logo meant assigning rows you may not have wanted to touch,
and a payee whose backlog was already empty could not be edited at all.
These cover the direct path that replaces it.
