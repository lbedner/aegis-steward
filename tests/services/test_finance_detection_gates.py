"""What detection is allowed to call a recurring stream.

The old rule was: 3+ transactions whose MEDIAN gap lands within +/-20% of
a canonical cadence. Both halves are too weak on real data.

Stewart's Shops - a convenience store - was detected as a yearly
subscription at 90% confidence from four visits with gaps of 2044, 430
and 17 days and amounts from $2.69 to $85.32. The median gap (430) fell
inside +/-20% of a year, because 20% of 365 is a 73-day window. Across
325 streams, 55% had a biggest gap at least 5x their smallest: no rhythm
at all.
