# Building a Finance Research Agent

A research agent answers open-ended questions about your money by writing
code over your real data: "does my allocation still make sense given my
envelope commitments?" is a novel computation, not a lookup, and code mode
lets the agent compose it on the fly.

## The pieces

Three things make an agent a research agent:

1. **The `code_mode` flag** on its agent row, which grants sandboxed
   script execution (see [Code Mode](code-mode.md)).
2. **The finance host tools**, registered by the finance service and
   seeded as grantable rows: `ledger_summary`, `positions`,
   `envelope_state`, `goals_state`, and `quote`.
3. **Tool attachments** connecting that agent to those tools.

## Setting one up

Flag an agent and attach the finance tools. With the seeded default agent:

```python
from sqlmodel import select

from app.core.db import get_async_session
from app.services.ai.domains.chat.agent_registry import update_agent
from app.services.ai.models.agents import Agent, AgentTool, Tool

FINANCE_TOOLS = [
    "ledger_summary",
    "positions",
    "envelope_state",
    "goals_state",
    "quote",
]

async with get_async_session() as session:
    await update_agent("assistant", {"code_mode": True}, session=session)
    agent = (
        await session.exec(select(Agent).where(Agent.slug == "assistant"))
    ).one()
    tools = (
        await session.exec(select(Tool).where(Tool.name.in_(FINANCE_TOOLS)))
    ).all()
    for tool in tools:
        session.add(AgentTool(agent_id=agent.id, tool_id=tool.id))
    await session.commit()
```

The tool rows exist because fixture seeding syncs every registered tool
into a grantable row; if a name is missing, re-run the database seed.

## What a turn looks like

Ask the flagged agent an analysis question through any chat surface. The
model sees a single `run_code` tool plus typed stubs for the granted
finance tools, writes a script such as:

```python
holdings = await positions()
total = sum(p["market_value_cents"] for p in holdings)
by_ticker = {
    p["ticker"]: round(100 * p["market_value_cents"] / total, 1)
    for p in holdings
}
envelopes = await envelope_state()
committed = sum(e["monthly_credit_cents"] or 0 for e in envelopes)
{"allocation_pct": by_ticker, "monthly_committed_cents": committed}
```

and narrates the result. Data the app already holds is pushed into the
script through the tools; the model never re-fetches what your code
already knows. `quote` is the one dynamic lookup, for prices the model
decides it needs mid-analysis.

If a script fails (bad syntax, an unsupported Python feature), the
traceback returns to the model as the tool result and it rewrites the
script inside the same turn. Usage lands in the ledger as one row per
turn under the agent's slug.

## Owner scoping

The finance tools read unscoped, matching the single-tenant default-open
posture of generated stacks. Before granting these tools in a
multi-tenant deployment, thread your user context into
`app/services/finance/ai_tools.py`.
