# Development Guide

This guide covers how to develop and maintain aegis-steward.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.14+
- UV package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and enter the project
cd aegis-steward

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
make run                 # or: uv run poe run
```

Every `make <target>` below also runs as `uv run poe <target>`. Same tasks,
no `make` needed - which is how Windows gets through the rest of this page.
`uv run poe -h` lists them.

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
make run          # Start with Docker
```

### Choosing the ASGI server

The webserver runs on uvicorn by default. Granian, a Rust-backed server,
ships alongside it and is selected per run:

```bash
make serve ENGINE=granian   # this run only
make serve                  # back to uvicorn
```

Deployments set `WEBSERVER_ENGINE=granian` in the env file instead, the
same way any other deploy setting is set.

### Choosing the event loop

A second, independent axis. `WEBSERVER_LOOP` defaults to `auto`, which
resolves to uvloop when it is installed and asyncio otherwise:

```bash
make serve LOOP=rloop       # granian only
make serve                  # auto: uvloop when installed
```

`auto` is resolved by the app, not handed to the server, and it will never
select rloop on its own. Granian's own `auto` prefers rloop the moment it
is importable, so a transitive dependency could otherwise move a
deployment onto an alpha event loop with no code change and nothing in the
logs.

Not every loop works with every engine:

| | asyncio | uvloop | rloop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| uvicorn | yes | yes | no |
| granian | yes | yes | yes |

A combination that cannot work fails at startup naming what the running
engine accepts. Only uvloop is installed by default; rloop is opt-in and
Unix-only, and on the endpoints measured so far it performs the same as
uvloop under granian, so there is no reason to reach for it yet.

Worth knowing about the loop generally: it matters far more under uvicorn
than under granian. Granian handles HTTP in Rust and only touches the
Python loop at the application's await points, so swapping the loop
underneath it moves very little.

To see which is faster for your endpoints:

```bash
make bench-engines                      # /health/, the default
make bench-engines ARGS="--list"        # what this app exposes
```

It boots the app once per engine and drives the same load at each. Point
it at any route your app serves, with the same flags `api-load-test run`
takes:

```bash
# Path parameters
make bench-engines ARGS="--path /api/v1/jobs/{job_id} --path-param job_id=abc-123"

# A POST with a body
make bench-engines ARGS="--method POST --path /api/v1/things --payload '{\"name\":\"x\"}'"

# An auth-gated route (a token is minted for you; --as-user, --anon also work)
make bench-engines ARGS="--path /api/v1/private/ --as-admin"

# Heavier load
make bench-engines ARGS="--path /api/v1/things/ -n 10000 -c 100 --rounds 3"
```

Pick the routes that carry your traffic. The ratio is a property of your
app, not of the server: the more work the handler does, the less the
engine matters. A trivial route can show granian well ahead while a route
that waits on the database shows the two within noise of each other.

It prefers ApacheBench (`ab`, bundled on macOS, `apt install
apache2-utils` on Debian) and falls back to the project's own
`api-load-test` for methods `ab` cannot issue, or when `ab` is missing.
That fallback client tops out below what either engine serves, so it
reports them as equal; the output always says which driver ran and why.

Two behavioral differences are worth knowing:

- Granian sends no server-initiated WebSocket keepalive ping, so the
  ping-timeout settings the uvicorn path carries have no equivalent and
  are not needed.
- Granian offers the `http.response.pathsend` extension, which hands
  static files to the server to send directly. Any middleware that
  rewrites a response body has to handle that message, not just
  `http.response.body`.

### Health Monitoring
```bash
make health         # Check system health
make health-detailed # Detailed health information
make health-json    # JSON health output
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make test           # Run test suite
make lint           # Check code style
make typecheck      # Run type checking
make check          # Run all checks
make fix            # Auto-fix code issues
```

### Documentation
```bash
make docs-serve     # Serve documentation locally (http://localhost:8001)
make docs-build     # Build static documentation
```

## Adding New Features

### 1. Create Business Logic
Add pure business logic functions to `app/services/`:

```python
# app/services/my_service.py
async def process_data(data: str) -> str:
    """Process data and return result."""
    return f"Processed: {data}"
```

### 2. Add API Endpoints
Create routes in `app/components/backend/api/`:

```python
# app/components/backend/api/my_endpoints.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
from app.services.my_service import process_data

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/process")
async def process_endpoint(data: str):
    result = await process_data(data)
    return {"result": result}
```

Register in `app/components/backend/api/routing.py`:

```python
from app.components.backend.api import my_endpoints

def include_routers(app: FastAPI) -> None:
    app.include_router(my_endpoints.router, prefix="/api", tags=["processing"])
```

### 3. Add Background Tasks
Create worker tasks in `app/components/worker/tasks/`:

```python
# app/components/worker/tasks/my_tasks.py
async def background_process_data(data: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Process data in background."""
    logger.info(f"Processing {data} in background")
    
    # Your processing logic here
    result = f"Processed: {data}"
    
    return {
        "status": "completed",
        "result": result,
        "timestamp": datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    }
```

Register in worker queue (`app/components/worker/queues/system.py`):

```python
from app.components.worker.tasks.my_tasks import background_process_data

class WorkerSettings:
    functions = [
        system_health_check,
        background_process_data,  # Add your task here
    ]
```

### 4. Add Scheduled Tasks
Add jobs to the scheduler component:

```python
# In app/components/scheduler/main.py
from app.services.my_service import process_data

# Add to create_scheduler function
scheduler.add_job(
    lambda: process_data("scheduled"),
    trigger="cron",
    hour=2,  # Run at 2 AM daily
    id="daily_processing",
    name="Daily Data Processing"
)
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
make test           # All tests
make test-verbose   # Verbose output
```

### Writing Tests
Create tests in the `tests/` directory:

```python
# tests/services/test_my_service.py
import pytest
from app.services.my_service import process_data

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_process_data():
    result = await process_data("test")
    assert result == "Processed: test"
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run
make docker-build
make docker-up

# Or use profiles for specific components
docker compose --profile dev up
```

### Environment Configuration
Configure `.env` file for your environment:

```env
# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Scheduler Configuration  
SCHEDULER_TIMEZONE=UTC
```

## Monitoring and Health Checks

aegis-steward includes comprehensive health monitoring:

- **Health Endpoints**: `/health/` and `/health/detailed`
- **CLI Commands**: `aegis-steward health check`
- **Component Monitoring**: Automatic health checks for all components

See [Health Monitoring](health.md) for complete details.
