"""The ``ai`` command group.

``main.py`` imports this module and reads ``app``, so every command
module must be imported here for its ``@app.command`` decorator to
run. Those imports look unused and are not - they ARE the
registration, which is why the names are asserted in
``tests/cli/test_ai_cli_registration.py``.
