"""
Worker entrypoint for aegis-steward.

Starts one queue's arq worker inside a loop it owns.

Not ``python -m arq <settings>``: arq's CLI calls
``asyncio.get_event_loop()`` with no running loop, which is a
RuntimeError on Python 3.14. Its own watch flag hid that by running the
worker inside ``asyncio.run`` - so the dev branch worked and the
non-dev branch had been dead for as long as this project has been on
3.14. One entrypoint for both, and it starts the loop itself.
