"""Web search, for the organization nobody has heard of (#173).

Searching is a capability, not a fact about a contact: a payee nobody
recognizes, a merchant behind an unattributed charge and an institution
off a statement all want it. So it lives here, and callers decide what a
hit means. A result is only ever a candidate: ``matters.domain_lookup``
still fetches it and checks the name is on the page.

Off unless ``BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`` is set. That is the whole setting:
absent means off, not an error or a warning on every call.

The cache and the daily budget are the privacy mechanism, not only a
cost control. One query for a nursing home is nothing; a year of them
reads as a profile of the household. A repeated lookup emits no new
query, and a day can only emit so many.

Queries name the ORGANIZATION, never the household: no person, no case
number, no document text.
