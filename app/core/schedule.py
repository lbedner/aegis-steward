"""The jobs this project runs on a schedule, declared by their services.

Each service lists its jobs in ``app/services/<service>/scheduled_jobs.py`` as
``JOBS``, a tuple of ``ServiceJob``; ``service_jobs`` collects every one.
The scheduler schedules each entry and, in a stack with a worker, the
worker registers each as a task named after its function, so the two read
one list and cannot drift apart. Found on disk through
``app.core.discovery``. The heartbeat is not here: it belongs to the
scheduler.
