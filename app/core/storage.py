"""Durable bytes, addressed by their own content.

The seam between "something needs to keep a file" and wherever files
actually live. One protocol, and backends that implement it: a local
filesystem here, a bucket in ``app.components.storage.s3`` when the
storage component is selected.

Keys are derived from the payload's SHA-256, never from a filename or a
path. That is the whole reason the backend can change later without a
migration: ``sha256/ab/cd/<digest>`` resolves identically on a disk, in
a bucket, and anywhere else, so adopting object storage is a byte copy
with no database change and no key rewriting. Rows that reference stored
bytes keep the key and the backend name; nothing outside a backend ever
builds a path.
