"""Credentials behind one interface: ``await get(name)``.

Every project has this. ``.env`` (with the process environment) is the
zero-setup backend: read-only, and a value changes on restart. A writable
store, the secrets component, plugs in behind the same calls
(``set_store``), the way object storage sits behind ``app.core.storage``.
A value set in ``.env`` wins over a stored one and is read-only elsewhere.

Names are the settings' own (``RESEND_API_KEY``), so one name works in
``.env``, in ``Settings`` and in the store. The code that reads a credential
with ``get`` declares it beside itself, as ``SECRETS = (Secret(...), ...)``
in a module listed in ``OWNERS``, like ``REDIS_KEYS``. Reading ``settings``
as usual is fine too: type the field ``Credential`` and it is listed,
read-only (``app.core.credential``).

Values are write-only from the outside: ``get`` hands one to the code that
uses it, and everything else (``status``, the Overseer page) sees where it is
set, its last four characters and when, never the value.

A declaration also says whether the app needs it (``needed``, decided by
config: the active AI provider's key, not the five it could use) and how to
check it (``verify``, one cheap call to the provider, usually ``probe``). A
value the provider refuses is never stored, so a typo fails at the paste.
