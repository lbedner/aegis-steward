"""What the Overseer saved, applied to this process as it starts.

Code reads ``settings`` synchronously, so a value saved while the app runs
reaches it on the next start: each process (webserver, scheduler, worker)
awaits ``apply_saved_overrides`` before its own work. A missing store or
table (migrations not yet run) never stops a process from booting: it runs
on ``.env``, which is already in effect.
