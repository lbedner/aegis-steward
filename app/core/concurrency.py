"""Running independent work concurrently, with a ceiling (``fanout``),
CPU work off the event loop (``cpu_bound``), and work not waited for
(``background``).

The slow thing in this stack is rarely the server and rarely the event
loop. It is a ``for`` loop over items that do not depend on each other,
each one waiting on a network call or a subprocess while the next one
waits its turn.

``asyncio.gather`` is the answer to that, but used bare it gets three
things wrong often enough to be worth wrapping once:

* **No ceiling.** A 500-page document becomes 500 concurrent OCR
  subprocesses, or 500 requests at a provider that rate-limits at ten.
* **First failure cancels the batch.** ``return_exceptions=True`` fixes
  that, and is easy to forget.
* **Results come back positionally**, which is right, but only if every
  caller remembers to keep the inputs aligned.

So: one spelling, and the concurrency limit is a parameter rather than a
thing each call site reinvents.
