"""Database activity worth a look: a transaction held longer than
``DATABASE_SLOW_TRANSACTION_SECONDS``, and a statement that found the
database locked, each with the process and the app code behind it; and,
on SQLite, every transaction held right now (``held``).

SQLite keeps no record of who held its lock, so a "database is locked"
failure used to be guessed at from timestamps. ``watch`` times every
transaction on an engine and catches lock failures; ``recent`` reads what
was recorded, for the Database pages. SQLite cannot say who holds its lock
either, so each process keeps its own open transactions and publishes the
ones held past ``SHOWN_AFTER``, refreshed while held, gone once they end
or their process stops refreshing them. Records go through the shared cache
(Redis when the stack has it, so the webserver sees what the worker and
scheduler recorded; this process's memory otherwise) and expire after an
hour. Each is also logged, so a process without an event loop to write the
record from still leaves one.
