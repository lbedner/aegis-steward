"""Protocol shapes for ops adapters.

Two protocols, one per concern — explicitly NOT a flattened
``OperationsAdapter`` umbrella, because DNS-side semantics and
mail-side semantics share almost nothing. Keeping them separate makes
the abstractions tighter and lets future ops concerns (SSL, storage,
hosting, DB) define their own protocols without bending these.

These are ``typing.Protocol`` shapes (structural, not nominal) so an
adapter doesn't have to ``inherit`` — it just has to implement the
methods. Easier to evolve and easier to mock in tests.
