"""Load test service package.

Provides shared load-test infrastructure under ``common/`` plus
variant-specific subservices: ``worker/`` (when the worker component is
installed) and ``api/`` (always).

Worker-side public names are re-exported here for back-compat with the
pre-package import surface (``from app.services.load_test import
LoadTestService``). The re-export block is gated on ``include_worker`` so
projects without the worker component don't fail to import the package.
