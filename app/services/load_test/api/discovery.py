"""FastAPI route discovery for HTTP load testing.

``list_routes`` walks ``app.routes`` and returns one ``RouteInfo`` per
user-declared (method, path) combination. Auth detection works by
inspecting each route's dependant tree for a caller-supplied auth
callable, so this module stays agnostic about where auth lives in the
project.
