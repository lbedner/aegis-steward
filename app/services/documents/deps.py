"""FastAPI dependency providers for the document service.

Mirrors ``finance/deps.py``. ``get_owner_user_id`` centralizes owner
scoping in one place: it resolves to the authenticated user's id when the
auth service is present, else ``None`` (single-user / standalone) - so
route handlers stay auth-agnostic and never repeat the guard per
endpoint. Documents dedupe PER OWNER, so getting this wrong would make
one person's scan collide with another's.
