"""What each part of Redis is for: key families declared by their owners.

A module that writes Redis keys declares them beside the code that writes
them, as ``REDIS_KEYS = (KeyFamily(...), ...)``, and is listed in ``OWNERS``.
The keyspace map (Overseer's Redis page) scans the keys, sorts each into the
first family whose pattern matches, and reads a few samples per family for
size, TTL and how recently it was touched. Keys nobody claims are shown as
such, which is how a leftover or a typo gets noticed.
