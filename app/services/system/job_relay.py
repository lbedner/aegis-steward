"""Watching jobs this process is not running.

With a worker in the stack, the work happens elsewhere and writes its
progress to a shared store. The web server still has to answer for those
jobs - list them, stream them, say when they land - and it does that by
polling the store and feeding the same subscriber queues a local job
would have fed.

That is the whole job of this module: turn a store that must be asked
into changes that arrive. The runner owns local jobs and delegates
everything remote here, so neither half has to carry the other's
concerns.
