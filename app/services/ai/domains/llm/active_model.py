"""Runtime active-model override.

The model the app is actually using, stored in the database rather than in
``.env``. Switching writes here and mutates the live settings object, so a
change from the Cloud Catalog tab or from ``llm use`` takes effect on the next
request instead of on the next restart.

Why settings mutation rather than a lookup at read time: ``get_ai_config`` is
synchronous and constructed in half a dozen places, including
``AIService.__init__``. Making it await a database read would push async up
through every one of those call sites. Applying the override *to* settings
keeps the resolution path untouched, and the startup hook replays the stored
choice into each process as it boots.
