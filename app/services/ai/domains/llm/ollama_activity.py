"""
Ollama model activity tracker.

Ephemeral, in-process record of models moving in and out of Ollama's
memory, powering the dashboard's Activity tab. Deliberately memory-only
(a bounded deque, same shape as the system activity feed): the tab
answers "what just happened", not an audit question, so events reset
with the process.

Events arrive two ways:

- ``record_loaded`` / ``record_unloaded``: explicit calls this app made
  through ``OllamaClient`` (the dashboard's Load/Unload buttons).
- ``observe``: a diff of the running-model set taken on every health
  poll. This is how idle evictions (``keep_alive`` expiry) and loads
  triggered outside the app get noticed - Ollama has no event API, so
  polling is the only signal.
