"""What the agent can see this turn, as a fact it can be asked for.

An agent's answer is only ever as good as what rode into the model with
it, and until now nothing could say what that was. "Do you still have
the page I pasted?" was unanswerable from the inside: history is
budgeted by SIZE and the oldest turns drop silently, so an agent that
had lost four Amazon pages sounded exactly like one that had them and
found no match.

``record_turn_context`` stamps the assembled shape at the moment the
prompt is built; the ``context`` tool reads it back. The stamp holds
SIZES and COUNTS, never the text - repeating the transcript into the
transcript is how a context report doubles the thing it is reporting on.
