"""Per-tool-call ledger for chat agents.

``llm_usage`` records a turn: model, tokens, cost, duration. It cannot say
which tool ran inside it. That gap matters as soon as an agent has more than
a couple of tools, because the questions you want to ask are about the tools
and not the turn: which ones are never reached for, which are always called
together, and how often a turn spends its whole call budget and still answers
short.

Instrumentation hangs off ``resolve_tools`` - the single seam every agent's
callables pass through - so a new tool is measured by existing, and no tool
module has to remember a decorator.

Two things are deliberate:

* **Turn identity is a context variable**, set once around the model call the
  same way ``memory_user`` binds the turn's owner. The kit is generic over a
  deps type it never inspects, so there is nowhere on deps to put it.
* **Ceiling hits are derived, not flagged.** Each row carries its index within
  the turn, so "this turn used its whole budget" is ``max(call_index) + 1 ==
  the agent's tool-call limit`` at query time. Nothing has to know the limit
  at write time.

Recording never fails a turn. A ledger that can break the feature it measures
is worse than no ledger.
