"""ToolChatAgent — streaming tool-calling chat over pydantic-ai.

GENERIC. Wraps a pydantic-ai ``Agent`` with the chat kit's contracts: per-turn
context providers, a bounded tool loop, exact usage capture through the shared
ledger, and a frame-based streaming output. A caller supplies the model, a
frozen persona (``instructions``), tools, a deps type, and context providers;
the kit owns the turn mechanics.

Cache-aware turn shape: the persona is the constructor ``instructions``; the
per-turn context blocks are appended as RUN instructions (pydantic-ai appends
them after the constructor's), so the whole system block is persona + context
— stable bytes whenever the context is stable, which a provider cache
breakpoint serves at ~0.1x. Prior turns ride ``message_history`` (append-only,
caches incrementally); the current prompt is the user's plain message. Editing
the system prompt with *volatile* content every turn — what the template's
CLI chat does with health/usage snapshots — is what busts a cache; stable
context in the system block is what feeds one.
