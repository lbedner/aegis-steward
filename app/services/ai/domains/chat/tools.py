"""Agent tool registry.

Maps tool names to Python callables. The ``tool`` table's rows key into
this registry by ``name``: the database decides WHICH tools an agent may
call (via ``agent_tool`` attachments); this module decides WHAT each name
executes. Framework-agnostic on purpose - entries are plain callables in
whatever shape the chat engine accepts (pydantic-ai takes functions or
``Tool`` instances), and nothing here imports an AI framework.

Applications register their own domain tools at import time:

    from app.services.ai.domains.chat.tools import register_tool

    async def lookup_order(order_id: str) -> str:
        \"\"\"Fetch an order summary.\"\"\"
        ...

    register_tool("lookup_order", lookup_order)

A database row naming a tool with no registered callable is skipped with
a warning, never an error: a stale row must not brick chat.
