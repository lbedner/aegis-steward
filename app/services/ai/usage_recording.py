"""LLM usage extraction, pricing, and ledger writes — module-level.

Extracted from ``AIService`` so non-chat callers (the insight generation
pipeline, future one-shot agents) can price and record LLM calls without
instantiating the chat service (whose ``ConversationManager`` runs
``init_database()`` on construction — a ``create_all`` that must never race
Alembic in worker processes). ``AIService`` delegates here; the price
lookup lives in exactly one place.
