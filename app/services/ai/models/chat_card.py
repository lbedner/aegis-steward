"""A card Illiana drew in a reply (#266), with its data frozen into it.

A card is an answer given at a time: re-resolving its rows at render time
would quietly rewrite it, so the chart drawn on Tuesday would show
Thursday's numbers beside Tuesday's sentence. The payload is stored as
she computed it, shaped by its kind's schema (``domains/chat/cards.py``).

Addressed by id, never by payload: the stored trace clips tool results at
2 KB, so the message carries only a marker ``{"kind": "chat_card", "id"}``.
