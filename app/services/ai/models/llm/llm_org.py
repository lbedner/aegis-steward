"""Organizations in the model economy: makers, servers, or both.

One table because they are one KIND of thing wearing different hats.
OpenAI both builds weights and serves them; Meta builds and serves
nothing; DeepInfra serves and builds nothing. Modelling "vendor" and
"lab" as separate tables duplicated every org that does both and left
no answer for "is this the same OpenAI?" - it is, and now it is one
row, with ``roles`` saying which hats it wears.
