"""Shared state for the AIService facade mixins.

Every mixin in this package composes into ``AIService`` and assumes the
attributes declared here: the live settings object, the resolved config,
the conversation manager, and the lazily-constructed sub-services. The
service-level exception types live here too so every mixin (and external
caller) imports them from one place.
