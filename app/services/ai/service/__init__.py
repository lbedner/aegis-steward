"""AI service facade.

``AIService`` is composed from one mixin per concern, chained so each
layer may call the ones beneath it:

    AIServiceBase        state: settings, config, conversation manager
      └─ UsageMixin      token extraction, pricing, usage rollups
         └─ ContextsMixin   health/usage/catalog context builders
            └─ PromptMixin    persona overlay + per-request runtime construction
               └─ ChatMixin      the non-streaming turn
                  └─ StreamingMixin  the streaming turn
                     └─ VoiceMixin     empty (voice off)
    StatusMixin          conversations, status, validation (base only)

The composition below is the whole class - it declares no methods of its
own, and this package keeps the historical import path working:
``from app.services.ai.service import AIService``.
