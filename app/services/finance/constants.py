# --- Cadences -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE table. A cadence carries six independent facts, and they used to live
# in six hand-written maps across five modules: detection's canonical gaps,
# the forecast's step functions, the menus' labels, the create/update
# validator, the API schema's Literal, and the monthly-equivalent weights.
#
# They drifted, repeatedly, and every gap was found by a user rather than a
# test: the forecast could step semiannual before detection could name it,
# so a six-month insurance premium measured as "irregular" and disappeared
# from the projection; the menus were then extended but the validator was
# not, so the dropdown 422'd; the schema was missed after that, so the fix
# never reached the endpoint.
#
# Adding a cadence is now one entry here. Everything else derives.
#
# ``irregular`` and ``unknown`` are deliberately NOT in this table: they are
# what a stream stores when no cadence fits (or there is only one
# occurrence). They can be stored - the column's CheckConstraint allows them
# - but they cannot be stepped, offered in a menu, or weighed in a rollup,
# which is exactly the difference this table encodes.
