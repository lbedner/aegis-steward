"""Deciding what an import file would do, without doing any of it.

``plan_transactions`` is a PURE READ: it resolves every row to an
outcome - insert, duplicate, update, skip or error - and writes
nothing. ``preview_file`` returns a plan untouched and ``ingest``
executes one, so what the preview shows is by construction what a
commit would do rather than a parallel implementation that can drift.

Three matching lanes, most authoritative first: a provider id, a
content hash, and finally (account, date, amount) - the last absorbing
an EDIT made in the source app, so a renamed payee or re-categorized
charge updates the existing row instead of landing as a second copy of
the same money.
