"""Import pipeline: batch bookkeeping + two-lane transaction dedup.

Shared by every importer (OFX/QFX, QIF, CSV). Each run creates a
``finance_import_batch`` — short-circuiting an identical re-upload by
``file_sha256`` — writes one ``finance_import_batch_row`` per record, and
inserts new transactions while counting duplicates. Writes but does not commit
(the caller owns the transaction boundary).

``finance_import_batch`` / ``_row`` carry a NOT-NULL ``owner_user_id``; in
standalone (no-auth) mode the owner is ``None``, so it's coerced to the ``0``
sentinel for those two tables (transactions stay nullable).

Matching runs three lanes, most authoritative first: a provider id
(LANE 1), a content hash (LANE 2), and finally (account, date, amount)
(LANE 3), which absorbs an EDIT made in the source app - a renamed payee
or re-categorized charge updates the existing row instead of landing as
a second copy of the same money.

Classification is a PURE READ, split into ``plan_transactions``: it decides
every row's outcome (insert / duplicate / update / skip / error) without
writing anything. ``ingest_transactions`` executes a plan; ``preview_file``
returns one untouched — so what the preview shows is by construction what a
commit would do, not a parallel re-implementation that can drift.
