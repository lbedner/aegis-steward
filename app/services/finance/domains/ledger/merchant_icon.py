"""A payee's brand icon, resolved server-side and inlined as base64.

Why base64 rather than a URL the browser fetches - two independent
reasons, both verified live rather than assumed:

1. The upstream favicon service answers with no
   ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin``. Flutter web loads network images by
   fetch with CORS enforced, so a direct third-party URL is blocked and
   every icon silently degrades to the initial-letter avatar.
2. Pointing at our own origin with a RELATIVE path ("/api/v1/...") does
   not fix it either: Flet resolves a non-absolute ``Image.src`` against
   the app's assets directory, not the HTTP origin - and an absolute one
   would have to guess the browser-facing scheme/host through a tunnel.

Handing the bytes over directly sidesteps all of it.

The request path NEVER fetches. Resolution reads memory, then the
``finance_icon`` table; domains neither knows are handed to a background
task that fetches upstream and persists what it finds, so the first page
after a genuine miss renders the initial-letter fallback and the next one
has the icon. Before this, a process restart emptied the in-memory cache
and the next render paid ~130 sequential-ish upstream round trips inside
the request (observed: a 946ms overview that spent ~99% on favicons).

A domain that does not resolve is not an error - it is stored as a
NEGATIVE row (NULL bytes) so it is not retried until the row ages out,
and the frontend falls back to the initial-letter avatar, the same way an
unmatched merchant degrades everywhere else in this app.
