"""The payee memory: what a bank descriptor was taught to mean.

Naming a payee used to be a one-time stamp - ``assign_merchant`` set
merchant_id on the rows in front of you and nothing recorded what the
DESCRIPTOR meant, so the next import offered the same groups again. These
are the other half: written as payees are named, read when an import
creates a transaction.

Its own module rather than more of ``merchants``: that one is the payee
directory (CRUD, merge, the naming backlog), this is the memory of what
naming decided, and they are separately readable.
