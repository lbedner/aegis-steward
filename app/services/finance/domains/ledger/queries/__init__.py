"""Batched read queries for the ledger domain.

Set-shaped inputs, map-shaped outputs, so callers cannot reintroduce a
per-row query loop. Statement builders only - no business logic, no
writes.

One module per section of the ledger, matching the sibling that consumes
it: 54 of these reads have exactly one caller and it is always the
matching module. ``filters`` holds the predicate fragments more than one
section builds its WHERE out of.

The package boundary is the API. Callers say ``queries.foo(db, ...)``
whichever module ``foo`` lives in, so moving a read between sections is
never a call-site change.
