"""Promote recurring streams the user's own categorization marks as bills.

A Quicken export carries the user's category tree on every transaction;
anything filed under "Bills & Utilities" (or "Subscriptions") is a bill
by the user's own hand, which beats any cadence heuristic. Runs after
recurring detection: a derived stream whose member transactions live
under a bills-type category gets ``is_subscription=True``, which walks it
through the missed-payment rule's commitment gate.

Only ``is_subscription`` is set - ``is_user_confirmed`` stays an explicit
action in the Bills & Income tab, so the UI still distinguishes "your
export implied it" from "you clicked Confirm".
