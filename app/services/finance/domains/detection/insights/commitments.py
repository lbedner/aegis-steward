"""What counts as a commitment, and whether it is currently owed.

The vocabulary half of insights: predicates and rollups over a recurring
stream, no database and no rules. Half the app asks these questions - the
forecast, the Budget tab, the suggestion guards, the missed-payment nag -
so they answer once here rather than each surface deciding for itself
what "a bill" means. Muting taught us what per-surface treatment costs: a
muted bill vanished from the forecast but kept counting in the Bills
total, and the two disagreed by the whole bill.

Deliberately dependency-light (constants and models only) so a caller can
import it without dragging in the rules that read the database.
