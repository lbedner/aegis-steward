"""The nine deterministic "wasting money" rules.

Runs nightly after recurring detection. Writes ``finance_insight`` rows
(deduped on ``(owner, dedup_key)``) so the same alert isn't regenerated every
night. The rules:

- **price_hike** - a fixed-amount recurring stream charged more than last time.
- **fee_charged** - a bank/finance fee or interest charge hit an account.
- **overspend_category** - this month's category spend is way above its recent
  norm (needs >= 3 prior full months, else skipped silently).
- **large_transaction** - one charge far outside its own account's recent norm.
- **missed_recurring** - a mature stream's expected charge never showed up.
- **card_overdue** - the institution reports a credit account past due.
- **min_payment_gap** - a minimum payment due soon exceeds cash on hand.
- **high_apr_carry** - a balance is accruing interest at an expensive APR.
- **credit_utilization** - a card is close to its credit limit.
- **cash_runway** - scheduled bills walk the cash balance below zero.
- **subscription_creep** - the subscription total drifted well above its norm.

Every rule is deterministic: thresholds are module constants, tuned by test
rather than by config surface. Anything that reads these rows (the Insights
list, the analyst agent's daily note) consumes findings it did not make, so a
model can never invent an alert.

This is the finance-local path. When the insights service is present a bridge
can additionally emit through its event machinery; the local rows are the
source of truth for dedup + the finance modal's Insights list.

This module reads the database, which is why the commitment vocabulary
(``is_commitment``, ``is_paused``, ``commitment_rollup``) sits in
``commitments`` instead: half the app needs those predicates and none of it
should have to import the rules to get them.
