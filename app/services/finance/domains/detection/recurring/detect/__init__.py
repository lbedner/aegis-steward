"""Finding the recurring streams hiding in a transaction history.

Split by stage - ``shared`` for what a candidate is, ``streams`` for
writing one down, ``purge`` for retiring what no longer holds, ``run``
for the pass that uses all three.

``_resolve_payee_key`` is re-exported because callers import it from
here, as they did when this was one module; it belongs to
``payees`` and only passes through.
