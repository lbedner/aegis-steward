"""Months ahead, and reading a plan out of plain language.

The outlook runs the header's own equation forward - bills at face value
on their real cadence, so the month the annual premium lands looks like
that month rather than like an average. Goal parsing is the other
forward-looking verb: it turns "cut back on Starbucks" into the numbers a
budget line would need.
