"""Uncovered spending: outflows no bill and no budget limit accounts for.

The sixth term of the month equation. Without it, unplanned spending is
invisible and every future month reads optimistic by exactly that amount
(confirmed live: ~40% of real spending sat in no bucket).

The subtlety this module exists for is that not all of it is a RATE.
Averaging a window that contains a one-off car repair asserts the repair
recurs, and the figure stays inflated for as long as the window holds it.
So a rate must be earned twice: the category's own history has to show
a habit (active in at least half the months since first seen), and even
then each window month is capped at a multiple of the median month -
the capped portion averages into the rate, the excess reports at face
value.

    (reported live: a $1,734 repair became $578/mo of phantom cost).

    A rate needs a HABIT, and the window alone cannot see one: dental
    work that clusters into the window's three months looks exactly like
    groceries. So the judgment is split. History decides whether a habit
