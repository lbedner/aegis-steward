"""Finance service facade.

``FinanceService`` is a thin delegating facade: every method forwards to a
domain module (``accounts``, ``transactions``, ``budgets``, ...) as
``module.func(self.db, ...)``. New code should call the domain modules
directly; the facade exists so routes, jobs, and the CLI keep a single
injection point (``deps.get_finance_service``).

One mixin per domain area, each sitting opposite the module it forwards
to, so "where does the facade expose budgets" has an answer that is a
filename rather than a line number. The composition below is the whole
class - it declares no methods of its own.

Every read statement lives in a per-package ``queries.py`` under
``domains/`` and ``adapters/``; domain modules
own writes and orchestration. Writes ``db.add(...)`` + ``db.flush()`` but do
NOT commit - the caller (route / CLI / scheduler job) owns the transaction
boundary. Rows are owner-scoped by ``owner_user_id``.
"""

# Aliased, and it has to be: importing ``service.budgets`` below binds that
# submodule onto this package as the attribute ``budgets``, which silently
# replaces an unaliased ``planning.budgets`` import and turns the gate
# mirrors underneath into AttributeErrors.
