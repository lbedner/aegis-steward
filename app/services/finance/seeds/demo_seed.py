"""Deterministic demo dataset for the finance service.

Turns an empty install into one that looks like a working app: a handful of
accounts, months of believable activity, detected recurring streams and
transfers, investment positions, and a net-worth curve. Built for dashboard
development, docs screenshots, and a first-run impression that isn't a wall of
empty states.

Everything goes through the real service layer (``FinanceService``,
``imports``, the ``detection`` finders, ``networth``) rather
than raw inserts, so the seeded data exercises the same code paths a real
import does - and stays correct when those paths change.

Two properties make it safe to re-run:

- **Marked.** Seeded accounts carry ``metadata["demo_seed"]``, and everything
  else hangs off them. Identification never depends on names, so ``reset``
  deletes exactly what this module wrote and can't touch real data that
  happens to share a payee or account name.
- **Deterministic.** The ledger is planned by a pure function off a fixed
  seed, so the same anchor date always produces the same dataset. The
  calendar window is anchored to today, so the dashboard shows a current
  curve; the amounts, payees, and cadences do not drift between runs.
