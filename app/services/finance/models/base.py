"""Shared column helpers and the schema every finance table is bound to.

SQLModel tables for the finance aggregator. Grown incrementally across the
finance schema tickets; the migration in ``aegis.core.migration_generator``
(``FINANCE_MIGRATION``) is the parallel definition and must stay column-for-
column compatible (tests build tables from these models via
``SQLModel.metadata.create_all``; the generated project builds them from the
migration).

The one stack-conditional line in the whole model layer lives here
(``_SCHEMA``), which is why this file is a template and its siblings are
plain Python.

Conventions (see docs/plans/finance-service/finance-schema-canonical.md):
- int autoincrement PKs; money + scaled integers use ``BigInteger`` (net worth
  and ``*_e8`` values overflow int32);
- enums are ``String`` + ``CheckConstraint`` (portable across SQLite/Postgres),
  never native enums; provider taxonomies that grow are plain ``str`` columns;
- partial-unique indexes declare BOTH ``sqlite_where`` and ``postgresql_where``;
- timestamps are naive UTC via ``_utcnow``;
- on Postgres every finance table lives in a dedicated ``finance`` schema
  (``_SCHEMA``); SQLite has no schemas so ``_SCHEMA`` is None (default DB).
  Tests run on SQLite and attach an in-memory ``finance`` database per the
  conftest schema-attach, so schema-qualified models still create_all cleanly.
