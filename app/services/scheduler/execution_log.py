"""Persist scheduled-job execution history (timing, status, errors).

Written by the scheduler process's APScheduler event listeners and read by
the backend API for the dashboard History view. Every function is
best-effort: logging a run must never break the run itself, so failures
are swallowed and logged at debug level.

Datetimes are stored naive-UTC to match the ``sa.DateTime()`` columns and
to keep ``finished_at - started_at`` duration math from mixing aware and
naive values.
