"""The stamp signatures: proof-objects for every shipped migration.

The startup hook re-adopts a persisted database by checking, per pending
migration (``NNN_<service>.py``), whether its signature object already
exists - and stamping instead of replaying DDL. A migration that ships
WITHOUT an entry opts out of that recovery and re-creates the
finance_icon incident: alembic_version lags, the upgrade replays, and the
database logs "already exists" on every boot until someone stamps by
hand. Guarded by ``tests/test_migration_signatures.py``.

Forms:
- ``("table", name)`` - table exists (CREATE TABLE migrations). Names may
  be schema-qualified; matching tolerates the bare name on engines
  without schemas (SQLite).
- ``("column", table, col)`` - column exists (ALTER TABLE migrations).
- ``("foreign_key", table, col)`` - an FK constraint covers the column
  (FK-only migrations, e.g. payment_auth_link).
