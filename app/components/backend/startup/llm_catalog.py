"""What the LLM catalog needs on boot, in one place.

Two questions, each asked only when the answer could be "nothing yet":
is the remote catalog populated, and - on an install that runs on
Ollama - are the locally pulled tags registered. Both are guarded so a
dev hot-reload never re-runs a sync against a catalog that is already
current, and both treat an unreachable source as a warning, not a
failed boot.
