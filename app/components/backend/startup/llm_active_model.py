"""Apply the stored active-model override at startup.

The model in use is a database row, not an ``.env`` value, so that switching
from the Cloud Catalog tab or from ``llm use`` takes effect without a restart.
This hook replays that choice into the live settings as each process boots,
so a restart keeps the selection and the scheduler/worker agree with the
webserver.

``.env`` remains the bootstrap default: it is what a fresh install runs on
until something writes an override.
