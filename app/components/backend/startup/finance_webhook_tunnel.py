"""
Plaid webhook tunnel startup hook.

The dev compose overlay runs a cloudflared quick-tunnel sidecar
(``plaid-tunnel``) that exposes the backend on a random public
``*.trycloudflare.com`` hostname and sets ``PLAID_TUNNEL_METRICS_URL``.
This hook discovers that hostname from the sidecar's ``/quicktunnel``
metrics endpoint, then:

1. Overrides the webhook URL new link tokens carry
   (``set_runtime_webhook_url``), and
2. Reconciles every existing Plaid Item via ``/item/webhook/update`` —
   the hostname rotates on every ``docker compose up``, so without this
   step old Items would deliver webhooks to a dead tunnel.

Gates — a no-op with a single log line unless ALL of:

1. ``PLAID_TUNNEL_METRICS_URL`` is set (the overlay sets it; prod and
   plain compose don't).
2. ``PLAID_CLIENT_ID`` is set: ``make serve`` only starts the tunnel with
   Plaid credentials, so without them there is nothing to discover.
3. The tunnel answers within the discovery window (cloudflared may still
   be provisioning when the backend boots, so discovery retries).

Only ``PLAID_WEBHOOK_PATH`` answers through the tunnel: the tunnel guard
middleware refuses everything else, because the app has no login.

Runs as a fire-and-forget task so a slow tunnel never delays startup,
and never raises — this is a dev convenience, it must degrade silently
(mirrors the payment webhook forwarder hook).
