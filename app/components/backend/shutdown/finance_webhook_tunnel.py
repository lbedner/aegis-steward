"""
Plaid webhook tunnel shutdown hook.

Cancels the discovery task launched by the paired startup hook under
``app/components/backend/startup/``, and drops the runtime webhook URL
that task installed.

Both halves matter. The task polls cloudflared for up to ~20 seconds and
only THEN sets a module-global webhook URL and opens a database session,
so an uncancelled one keeps running long after the app that started it is
gone: it holds a connection open past shutdown, and it rewrites global
state belonging to whatever is running by the time it resolves. Leaving
the URL behind is the same problem a step later, since it points at a
tunnel hostname that dies with the process.

No-op when the startup hook never launched a task, which is every
deployment that is not the dev overlay. Never raises: this is a dev
convenience and must not block the way down (mirrors the payment webhook
forwarder's own shutdown hook).
