"""Per-source request-volume monitor — Overseer's "who's hammering you" view.

Sibling of the in-memory performance metrics service, but keyed on the
*source* (client IP) rather than the route: it counts requests per IP so an
operator can see at a glance when one address is driving a disproportionate
share of traffic, and the read path flags that source as "dominant."

Two backends, chosen the way ``CacheService`` picks one:

* **Redis** when a URL is configured (the Redis component is included) -
  shared across the webserver / scheduler / worker processes and surviving a
  restart for the bucket's TTL.
* **in-memory** otherwise - per-process and lost on restart. That's fine: the
  live panel still works because requests are *recorded* and *read back* in
  the same (backend) process. Cross-process auto-detection is the only thing
  that needs Redis, and that's a separate, optional tier.

Counts bucket by epoch hour so they age out on their own; only the heaviest
sources matter, so both backends keep just the top slice. Everything is
best-effort and fails OPEN - monitoring must never break a request or a panel.

Auto-discovered by ``backend_hooks`` because the file lives in
``app/components/backend/middleware/`` and exposes ``register_middleware``.
