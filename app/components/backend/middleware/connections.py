"""Every WebSocket and event stream, open now and recently closed.

The Overseer's Server > Connections section reads ``history()``. Nothing
else lists them: uvicorn keeps its own set but the app cannot reach it,
and each stream's subscriber set only knows itself. A WebSocket is
listed once accepted; an HTTP response once it starts as
``text/event-stream``. A WebSocket client that comes back (same path,
address and browser) within ``GRACE_SECONDS`` of dropping is the same
connection reconnecting, so a Flet tab riding out a hot reload is one row
with a timeline, not a new row each time. An event stream can say so
exactly: its first frame is its record's id, the browser's own retry
sends that back as ``Last-Event-ID``, and only that links it; a new page
opening the same stream (every Overseer page opens ``/overseer/events``)
is a new connection, and one that closes is closed.

Each record names the server process that owns it, and each process
renews a short heartbeat. A record left "up" by a process that died
without closing it (a hot reload that timed out) reads as closed ("server
went away"), and the client coming back links to it as a reconnect.

Each connection's record lives in the shared cache (``app.core.cache``):
Redis when the project has it, so history outlives a restart and covers
every worker, and process memory otherwise. Records are written on open
and close only; message counts while open stay in this process. A cache
failure is logged and never reaches the connection. The query string is
never kept (it can carry a token).
