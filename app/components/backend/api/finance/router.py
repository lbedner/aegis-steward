"""The finance API: one router, assembled from per-resource sub-routers.

Each submodule owns one resource's endpoints and defines its own
``APIRouter``; this aggregator mounts them all under ``/finance``. The
wiring registry imports ``router`` from exactly here, so the split is
invisible to routing - and to every caller, since sub-routers carry no
prefix of their own and the paths are unchanged.

Each include carries its own tag, so ``/docs`` renders one titled
section per resource instead of a single 101-route wall. Tags are an
OpenAPI-only concern - paths and behavior are unchanged - and the shared
``finance:`` prefix keeps the sections contiguous when the docs UI sorts
them alphabetically.

Provider connectivity and the analyst ride their own copier flags, which
is why their two includes are the only conditional lines.
