"""
Finance Service Detail Modal

A Quicken-style finance workspace, organised into tabs:

* **Accounts** — the register. A left sidebar lists accounts grouped into
  Banking / Credit / Investments / etc., each with its balance and a grand
  total; selecting one shows an account-detail header (with a Manage menu)
  above its transactions (or holdings, for investment accounts). The sidebar
  only lives on this tab.
* **Overview** — a net-worth summary (assets, liabilities, net worth) with a
  per-group breakdown. No sidebar; this is the "home" landing.

Data is fetched async through the internal ``APIClient`` (never a DB session
from the frontend). All colours, spacing, and type come from ``AegisTheme``.

# Named rows in the import review's detail sections before the tail folds
# into a count. A Quicken tree can carry hundreds of new categories, and a
# dialog that scrolls for a page stops being read at all.
# One height for every Overview card, so the row has a single baseline.
# Named slices in the spending donut (and rows in the list under it) before
# the tail folds into "Other". Five left "Other" as the biggest slice on any
# real ledger, which hides exactly the breakdown the card exists to show.
# Measured against a real ledger (23 parent-level categories after the
# spending_by_category rollup): 10 slices still left "Other" at 16.3%; 15
# gets it to 5.3%, with everything past #15 individually under 1% of total
# spend - the tail at that point really is "everything else", not a few
# disguised top categories. PieChartCard's legend scrolls within its fixed
# height (modal_sections.py) rather than clipping, so this isn't bounded
# by legend space anymore.

      (``UncategorizedPanel``, own instance, own data load - not a link
