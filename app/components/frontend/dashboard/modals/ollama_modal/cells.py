Six formatters, each the rule for one column: a quantization that
Ollama reports inconsistently, an id too long to show whole, a context
length in tokens, a capability as a tag, a modified date as elapsed
time. They are separate from the table because each is a rule worth
asserting on its own, and the generated model-table tests do.
