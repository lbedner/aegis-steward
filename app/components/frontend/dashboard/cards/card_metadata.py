"""Reading ``ComponentStatus.metadata`` without trusting its shape.

``metadata`` is ``dict[str, Any]`` and nothing validates it, so a card
gets whatever a health check published - which changes across upgrades,
and arrives in its own shape from a third-party plugin.

Its own module rather than ``card_utils``: that file is 659 lines of
recorded debt and may not grow, and this is a distinct concern anyway -
card_utils builds chrome, this reads payloads.
