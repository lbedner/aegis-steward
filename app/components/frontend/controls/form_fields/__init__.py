"""Form fields with one look, so a form reads as a form.

A package rather than one module, one file per kind of input.

Every name the rest of the app imported from ``controls.form_fields``
is re-exported here, including the three private ones other modules
had already reached for - ``_build_label`` (controls.pickers builds
its trigger label with it), ``_CLEAR_HIT_SIZE`` (a test asserts the
hit box), and the ``FormVariant`` alias. Splitting the module is not
the moment to renegotiate who may import what.
