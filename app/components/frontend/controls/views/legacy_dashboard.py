"""
Legacy dashboard wrapper.

The existing dashboard rendering predates the View/router architecture
— it's a 700-line closure inside ``flet_main``. Rather than rewrite it,
this thin wrapper hosts the body inside a real ``BaseView`` so the
router can navigate to it. ``on_enter`` calls into ``main.setup_dashboard``
which owns the actual rendering; ``on_leave`` cancels every background
task the dashboard spawned.

A future PR will inline this into a proper ``DashboardView`` with the
composition-in-``__init__`` style. For now this preserves the existing
dashboard while letting routing/login/logout flow through cleanly.
