"""A month calendar built from house controls.

Flet ships ``ft.DatePicker``, but it is a Flutter DIALOG themed through
``theme.date_picker_theme`` - and setting that property at all crashes the
page render on Flet 0.28.3 ("Null check operator used on a null value" at
route=/, reconnect-looping). Bisected to a single plain ``bgcolor``, so
there is no safe subset to reach for. Left untouched, the picker renders
as stock Material in the middle of a near-black app.

So the calendar is ours: ordinary Containers and Texts wearing
``AegisTheme``, shown through the same anchored ``Dropdown`` popup the
account filter and the payee picker already use. It inherits the app's
surface, border, radius and accent for free, and cannot be broken by a
theme property Flet mis-serializes.

The grid maths is deliberately separable from the rendering
(``month_grid``) - which day lands in which cell, and how a month rolls
over a year boundary, is the part worth testing without a page.
