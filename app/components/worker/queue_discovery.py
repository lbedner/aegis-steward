"""What every worker backend's registry does the same way.

The three backends differ in what a queue *is* - arq has a
``WorkerSettings`` class, TaskIQ and dramatiq have a broker - and in what
a task looks like once registered. They do not differ in how a queue is
found, how its metadata is shaped for the dashboard, or how a docstring
is read off a task, and writing those three times is how the task lists
they replaced went stale in two places at once.

A backend registry supplies the parts that are actually its own: a
predicate saying whether a module is one of its queues, a predicate
saying whether a member is one of its tasks, and the names its middleware
hooks go by. Everything else is here.
