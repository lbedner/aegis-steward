"""
Worker heartbeat for rolling-deploy drain detection.

Each worker SETEXs ``worker:<host>:<pid>:busy`` for the duration of a
job and refreshes the TTL on a background task/thread so the key never
expires mid-execution. The ``aegis deploy --rolling`` command polls
``SCAN`` for ``worker:*:busy`` after setting the pause flag and proceeds
once empty (or aborts on timeout). Keeping the signal in Redis — rather
than in broker internals — means the same deploy-side drain check works
regardless of queue library (taskiq, dramatiq, arq).

TTL is intentionally short (so a worker that dies mid-job disappears
from the drain check well before the deploy's drain timeout) and
refreshed at ``TTL / 2`` while the job runs (so jobs longer than the
TTL never self-expire).

Best-effort: a Redis blip must never fail a job, so callers should not
propagate exceptions from these helpers.

The busy key is process-scoped (``worker:<host>:<pid>:busy``), but a
single process runs jobs concurrently (taskiq async tasks, dramatiq
threads). The helpers reference-count in-flight jobs so the key and its
refresh loop are torn down only when the *last* job on the process
finishes — otherwise the first job to complete would delete the key
while siblings are still running and let the drain check proceed early.
