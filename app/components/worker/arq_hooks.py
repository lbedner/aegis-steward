"""The hooks every arq queue runs around its worker and its jobs.

arq has no middleware: each queue is its own worker process, configured by
its own ``WorkerSettings``, and arq reads the hooks from that class's own
``__dict__`` (``arq.worker.get_kwargs``), so an inherited hook never runs.
Each queue assigns these instead, built for its name:

    on_startup, on_shutdown, on_job_start, after_job_end = arq_hooks.for_queue(
        QueueName.SYSTEM, max_jobs
    )

TaskIQ and dramatiq do the same work once, in their event middleware. Only
arq stacks ship this module.
