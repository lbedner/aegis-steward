"""What each worker process runs with, checked against the settings.

Every engine gets its concurrency from ``Settings.WORKER_QUEUES`` (taskiq's
max async tasks, dramatiq's threads, arq's ``max_jobs``). The web process
cannot see a worker's command line, and each engine has its own defaults,
so every worker writes a small report to Redis on startup - what it runs
with next to what the settings ask for - refreshed while it lives and
expiring when it dies. The Overseer's Runtime section reads it.

Run as ``python -m app.components.worker.runtime concurrency <queue>`` it
checks the settings against the discovered queues (refusing to go on if
``WORKER_QUEUES`` names one that does not exist) and prints that queue's
concurrency, which the entrypoint hands to taskiq and dramatiq.
