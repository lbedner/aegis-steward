"""Re-run ``build_assets`` whenever a watched static source changes.

Plugs the gap between Tailwind (which only writes raw
``static/dist/app.css``) and ``build.py`` (which fingerprints it and emits
``manifest.json``). Without this the manifest goes stale the moment
Tailwind rebuilds: the browser keeps loading the previous fingerprinted
filename until somebody runs ``make build-static``.

Watches the same sources ``build.py`` fingerprints, debounces flurries of
writes (Tailwind emits several events per save), and runs
``build_assets()`` once per quiet period. Fail-soft: a watchdog blip logs
and keeps watching, because a CSS edit should never take down the dev
stack.

Run as ``python -m app.components.web_frontend.build_watch``.
