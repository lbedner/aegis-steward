"""Asset fingerprinting for the web frontend.

Hashes every CSS/JS asset under ``static/`` and emits a content-addressed
copy under ``static/dist/`` along with a ``manifest.json`` mapping logical
paths to built paths. The ``static()`` Jinja global reads that manifest, so
templates emit hashed URLs that ``CachedStaticFiles`` can serve as
immutable for a year.

Runs in two places:

- Docker build (prod): invoked in the runtime stage after the Tailwind
  output lands, so the image ships with a manifest.
- Dev (optional): run ``make build-static`` to preview the fingerprinted
  behaviour. When the manifest is absent — the common dev case — the
  ``static()`` helper degrades to unhashed paths, pages still render, and
  a one-hour Cache-Control plus ETag keeps the traffic cheap.

Pure stdlib on purpose: this runs before ``uv sync`` has finished in the
Docker build stage.
